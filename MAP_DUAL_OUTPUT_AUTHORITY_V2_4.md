# Shared Map Layered Generation Authority v2.4

Effective: 2026-08-19
Scope: Forest Symphony / PMD AutoChess Proto / CG Pet Battle Prototype

This document extends v2.3 and is mandatory for AI-generated layered maps/parallax environments intended for runtime authoring.

## 1. Ground-first remains mandatory
Generate `GROUND` first. Validate its road/path/water/plaza/plot geometry before PAR generation. Ground is the base geometry authority.

## 2. Ground-first alone is NOT enough
A PAR object being in the correct quadrant or approximately near the intended area is not acceptable. Major structures must be bound to explicit Ground anchors before PAR generation.

## 3. Placement Anchor Contract is mandatory
After Ground is accepted and before generating PAR, define a Placement Anchor Contract / footprint manifest for every major PAR structure.

Each anchor should include as applicable:
- unique object/plot ID;
- target bbox/polygon or center/footprint region on Ground;
- object type/owner (`PAR`);
- required nearby path/road relation;
- required water/crossing relation;
- entrance/front-facing relation where meaningful;
- allowed tolerance / acceptance note.

At minimum anchor:
- every house/building;
- central shrine/fountain/statue structure;
- bridges;
- gate/arch structures;
- market stall clusters;
- major treehouses/landmarks;
- any object visually constrained by a Ground plot, water feature, crossing or road.

If several similar plots exist, assign unique IDs. Objects may not silently exchange plots.

## 4. Footprint / relationship rules
- A house/building must materially occupy its assigned Ground plot/clearing and must not jump to another plot.
- A building entrance should connect/f face the intended local path when the layout implies one.
- A bridge must span its declared crossing corridor, not another part of the river/stream.
- Fountain/shrine stone structures must register around their declared Ground water/pad anchor, not recreate the water/pad elsewhere.
- Central structures must preserve the declared plaza/axis relationship.

## 5. PAR generation contract
Generate `COMPLETE PAR` only after Ground + Placement Anchor Contract are accepted. Use both as references/constraints. Do not rely on prose like “align closely” as the sole placement instruction.

If a single full-scene generation cannot maintain all anchors, prefer regional/object-group PAR generation tied to locked anchor regions, then assemble on the unchanged Ground canvas. Never solve drift by moving/rescaling Ground.

## 6. Placement QA Gate
After PAR generation, composite `GROUND + PAR` and inspect every declared anchor individually.

FAIL examples:
- house on the wrong dirt/building plot;
- house shifted away from its intended local path;
- bridge on the wrong stream segment;
- central shrine/fountain offset from its Ground pool/pad;
- market/treehouse/landmark occupying another anchor's region.

Whole-image attractiveness does not override anchor failure.

## 7. Object ownership
`GROUND = true base terrain + floor/road/plaza tiles + grass + flowers + water.`

`PAR = EVERYTHING ELSE.`

Object/content ownership is exclusive by visible structure, not by raw x/y alpha occupancy. Ground may reconstruct base material underneath a PAR structure, but must not duplicate the visible PAR object.

Bridge visible structure = PAR-only; under-bridge water/terrain/bank = Ground-only.
Fountain stone structure = PAR; fountain water = Ground.

## 8. PAR Purity / Alpha Integrity
PAR may contain only PAR-owned visible objects/structures. It must not include broad semi-transparent copies of Ground-class grass, roads, flowers, riverbank base or water merely to make compositing look smoother.

For normal pixel-art structures:
- prefer alpha 0 or 255;
- no broad partial-alpha haze;
- no feather halos;
- no anti-alias blur used to hide geometry mismatch;
- no sub-pixel drift.

Broad partial-alpha coverage is a warning/fail condition unless explicitly approved for a real visual effect.

## 9. Pixel-crisp gate
Runtime pixel layers require hard pixel edges, no blur/soft smoothing, no painterly reconstruction, and Nearest Neighbor for any pixel-art resize/downsample. Inspect at 100%, 200% or 400%; non-integer display zoom is not a formal crispness test.

## 10. Required workflow v2.4
`Shared Authority -> Project Precheck -> generate Ground only -> Ground geometry QA -> create Placement Anchor Contract / unique plot IDs -> generate PAR from accepted Ground + anchor contract -> per-anchor placement QA -> PAR purity + pixel-crisp QA -> recomposition/witness QA -> Runtime approval`

## 11. Promotion rule
A candidate remains DRAFT if any major anchor is wrong, even when overall registration looks close or the image is visually attractive. Spatial placement, content ownership, alpha purity and pixel crispness are independent gates.
